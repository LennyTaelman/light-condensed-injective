# LightProfiniteInjective

This is an experimental repository, cloned from <https://github.com/dagurtomas/LeanCondensed>. We add a proof
that non-empty light profinite spaces are injective objects in the category of light profinite spaces. This is due to Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze

## Code organisation

The main result is in `LightProfiniteInjective`. The rest of the code hierarchy is cloned from LeanCondensed, see link above.
