# LightProfiniteInjective

This is an experimental repository containing mathematics formalised in Lean 4. It was cloned from <https://github.com/dagurtomas/LeanCondensed>, and should eventually be merged with LenCondensed again.

This repository adds a proof that non-empty light profinite spaces are injective objects in the category of light profinite spaces, a result due to Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze

## Code organisation

The main result is in `LightProfiniteInjective`. The rest of the code hierarchy is cloned from LeanCondensed, see link above.
