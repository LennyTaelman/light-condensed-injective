# LightProfiniteInjective

This is an experimental repository containing mathematics formalised in Lean 4. It was cloned from <https://github.com/dagurtomas/LeanCondensed>. This repository adds a proof that non-empty light profinite spaces are injective objects in the category of light profinite spaces, a result due to Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze. This has now been merged again, see [this pull request](https://github.com/dagurtomas/LeanCondensed/pull/3).

## Code organisation

The main result is in `LightProfiniteInjective`.
